# from-scratch

Implementations of core machine learning systems built (mostly) from scratch in Python, focusing on architecture, data processing, and model design. 

Projects include:

- **Mini-LLM Transformer** – Custom-built transformer model for language modeling, with tokenization, attention, and training from scratch. I then built a live token-streaming system in Django so you can see the likelihoods of tokens *on every step*. [click here](https://github.com/log-y/llm-demo)
- **Automatic Speech Transcription System** – End-to-end speech-to-text pipeline including audio processing and decoding. Again, I built a Django front-end to see token classifications over time. [click here](https://github.com/log-y/sr-demo)

*Note: These projects prioritize learning and architectural understanding over production-grade performance.*
